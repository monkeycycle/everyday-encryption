        <p>
            Encoding messages or information so that only authorized parties can access and read the content.
        </p>
        <p>
            Encrypted messages are not hidden and can be captured at various points in transit and stored indefinitely.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strong encryption prevents the interceptor from accessing the original message or information.
