            No 3rd-party involvement in encrypting/decrypting.

        <p>
            The cryptographic keys are in the hands of sender and receiver to encrypt and decrypt.

        <li>Typical server-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee protection of communications between clients and servers, not between the communicating parties themselves.</li>

        <li>The company itself holds the cryptographic key data that lets it decrypt your messagesâ€”and so, therefore, does any hacker who compromises the company or government official standing over its shoulder.</li>
